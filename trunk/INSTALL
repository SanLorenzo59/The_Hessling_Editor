               Installation Notes for Un*x Port
               --------------------------------

Please read ALL of these notes before building THE!

To install THE, you first need to configure it.  This is done by
executing the configure script provided in this archive.  Because
THE can be configured to run with different Curses libraries and
with different Rexx interpreters, there are quite a few options
available when configuring.  To see these options, run:

configure --help

If you are interested in building different versions of THE on the
one platform; like the X11 version and a text mode version, then you can
do something like this.

To build a text-mode version of THE with "standard" curses and Regina:

mkdir curses
cd curses
../configure --with-rexx=regina
make the

To build the X11 version of THE with PDCurses (aka XCurses) and REXX/imc:

**** THE requires the file; xcurses.h.  This file is actually the curses.h
**** that is distributed with PDCurses.  Either make a copy of this file
**** called xcurses.h or make a symbolic link to it.

mkdir xcurses
cd xcurses
../configure --with-xcurses --with-cursesincdir=somewhere --with-curseslibdir=somewhere --with-rexx=rexximc
make the

The configure script looks in some common places for all the libraries (both
curses and Rexx).  These are defined in the configure script. Some of the
common directories are $HOME/include, /usr/local/include for header files
and $HOME/lib and /usr/local/lib for libraries.  There are several others;
see 'configure' for the full list.
If you build THE with the same Rexx interpreter, you can set REXXINCDIR and 
REXXLIBDIR environment variables to the include and lib directories
respectively.
These switches --with-rexxincdir and --with-rexxlibdir override the values
set in REXXINCDIR and REXXLIBDIR.
If you build THE with the same curses library, you can set CURSESINCDIR and
CURSESLIBDIR environment variables to the include and lib directories
respectively.
These switches --with-cursesincdir and --with-curseslibdir override the values
set in CURSESINCDIR and CURSESLIBDIR.

Once you have THE compiled, it can then be installed.  By default, the
THE executable will be installed into /usr/bin, while the supplied
macros will be installed into /usr/share/THE.  The base path "/usr"
can be changed by adding the --prefix=path (where path is the base path)
to the configure command.
eg. to install THE into /opt/bin and /opt/share/THE, configure --prefix=/opt ...
